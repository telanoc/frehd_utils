      ================================================================



This file contains patches that will allow your TRS-80 Model 4P to boot LS-DOS
6.3.1 directly from a hard disk.  Your system must meet all of the requirements
below.

This is version 2 of HDBOOT.  Improvements since version 1 include:
    1) Hard drives where one logical cylinder is more than one physical track
are now supported.
    2) Many gate-array machines would hang unless a disk was in floppy drive :0
during boot.  This has been fixed.
    3) A conflict with Michel Houde's XLR8er patches has been eliminated.
    4) The bootstrap step rate byte is no longer used.
Also, the system information sector on :0 is not altered, which eliminates
conflicts with other programs that use this information.

NOTICE: Changing any operating system, especially at this level, is a dangerous
operation.  If anything in this file is not absolutely clear to you, do NOT
attempt any modifications by yourself.
        The method in this file appears to work as described.  However, I do
not accept responsibility for any consequences of using the information in this
file, and any modifications to your system must be made at your own risk.



      ================================================================



                           System Requirements
                           -------------------


    1) TRS-80 Model 4P ONLY, not Model 4 or 4D.

    2) LS-DOS 6.3.1.

    3) A hard disk drive using the standard Radio Shack 8X300 or WD1010 con-
troller board.  This includes unmodified Radio Shack 5 and 15 meg drives.
This method might work on other drives that use a WD1000 or WD1010 controller
and the same port configuration, but has not been tested.
       On any hard drive used, LS-DOS logical drive :0 must lie entirely under
the first head (head 1) on the hard drive, and begin on track (and cylinder) 0.

    4) Use of Radio Shack TRSHD6 or Misosys RSHARD6 hard disk drivers when
running LS-DOS 6.3.1.  Other drivers have not been tested.

    5) If you're using an XLR8er board and Michel Houde's patches for it, the
patches here shouldn't affect those.  See "Instructions" step 2, below.







                               Instructions
                               ------------


All references to drive :0 refer to the first logical (and physical) drive on
your hard disk under LS-DOS 6.3.1

    1) Print out this file.  (It's already formatted for 80 columns, 66 lines.)
Read the entire file CAREFULLY, and make sure these instructions make perfect
sense to you.  If they don't, ask someone.

    2) Apply any other patches desired (e.g. XLR8er) to BOOT/SYS and SYS0/SYS
on your boot diskette, following their instructions.  Make sure your system
works correctly before attempting to use the patches here.

    3) Calculate the values for "vv vv vv" through "zz zz zz..." for the
HDBOOT/FIX patch, as explained in the table below.

    4) Backup your entire hard disk onto floppies.  If there are any problems
installing these patches, it is possible to lose some or all of the data on
your hard disk.

    5) Boot the hard disk system with your usual boot diskette.

    6) Execute BACKUP SYS0/SYS:d :0 (SYS), which will move both BOOT/SYS and
SYS0/SYS from your boot diskette to hard drive :0.  (Replace "d" with the drive
containing your boot diskette.)

    7) Use SYSGEN to create a CONFIG/SYS file on logical drive :0.

    8) With a text editor or word processor, extract the two patch files below
as HDBOOT/FIX and HDSYS0/FIX.  In the first, replace the "vv" through "zz"
letters with the values you calculated in step 3.

    9) Patch SYS0/SYS and BOOT/SYS on hard drive :0 with the commands:
            PATCH SYS0/SYS.SYSTEM6:0 USING HDSYS0
            PATCH BOOT/SYS.LSIDOS:0 USING HDBOOT

    10) If there was an AUTO command on your boot diskette, it has been auto-
matically transferred to drive :0.  Make sure that any programs invoked by your
auto command are on an accessible partition of your hard disk.

    11) Remove all floppy disks from the drives and press RESET.  In a few
seconds, your system should boot directly from the hard drive.  If so, you are
finished modifying your system.

    12) If your system does not boot properly, reboot with your boot diskette
(hold down <F2> while pressing RESET), and restore SYS0/SYS and BOOT/SYS on the
hard disk (see step 13).  You may either abandon the entire project, or attempt
it again.

    13) To remove the hard disk boot modifications, BACKUP SYS0/SYS:d :0 (SYS),

where "d" is a drive containing a copy of your LS-DOS 6.3.1 master disk.  Of
course, you'll need to use your boot diskette and hold down the <F2> key to
start up the hard disk after that.











                                  Notes
                                  -----


When using the modifications in this file, a few restrictions apply.

    1) The system will attempt to boot from the hard drive if it is turned on.
To boot from a floppy (Model III mode, for example), hold down the <F2> key
while pressing RESET.

    2) When booting, if the hard drive is not completely up to speed you may
see "The floppy disk drive is not ready."  Press RESET, and the system should
boot properly.
       Also, if you have an XLR8er speedup board installed, due to its slow
startup speed the system may not always boot on the first try.  Again, press
RESET, and the system should boot properly.

    3) The CONFIG/SYS file must be loaded when booting from the hard drive,
and cannot be suppressed.  If it cannot be loaded, the system will not boot.
In that case, you must boot with the boot diskette, and use SYSGEN to create a
valid CONFIG/SYS file on the hard disk's drive :0
       You may change your system configuration at any time, as long as it
meets the requirements above.  Merely boot the system from the hard drive,
establish the new configuration, and re-SYSGEN.  Save a copy of this new
configuration file on your boot diskette with SYSGEN (DRIVE=d).

    4) When booting from the hard drive, you cannot enter DEBUG by holding down
the <D> key, as this would prevent CONFIG/SYS from being loaded.  To enter
DEBUG in this manner, boot from a floppy.

       Of course, once you are at the "LS-DOS Ready" prompt, DEBUG may be used
as desired.

    5) An AUTO command may be installed on the hard disk's drive :0.  To fix a
runaway AUTO command, reboot with your boot diskette.

    6) Do not move the modified SYS0/SYS from hard drive :0 onto a floppy
diskette.  SYS0/SYS and BOOT/SYS have been modified for hard drive boot, and
the diskette will be unusable for booting either a floppy or hard disk system.



      ================================================================



For "vv vv vv," "ww," "xx," "yy," and "zz zz zz...," substitute the appropriate
values for drive :0 of your hard disk system.

vv vv vv = If each logical cylinder is the same as one physical track,
        then use 00 00 00.
           If each logical cylinder consists of more than one physical track,
        then use CD F7 43.
ww = Sectors per physical track, in hexadecimal.
        For example, sixty-four sectors per physical track would be 40 hex.
xx = Sectors per logical cylinder, in hexadecimal.
        For example, thirty-two sectors per logical cylinder would be 20 hex.
yy = Sectors per granule, in hexadecimal.
        For example, sixteen sectors per granule would be 10 hex.
zz zz zz... = values of DCT+3 through DCT+8 for hard disk drive :0.
        Boot the hard disk system with your boot diskette.  From the "LS-DOS
        Ready" prompt, use DEBUG to get the values in X'0473' through X'0478'.
