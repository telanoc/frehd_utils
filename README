This repository will contain my utilities for use with Frederic 
Vecoven's FreHD hard disk emulator for TRS-80 machines.

fsetboot.cmd - Set or clear the bootable flag of a hard disk
image on the FreHD.  This program currently (12 March 2023)
doesn't work on trs80gp's FreHD emulation.

fsetboot.asm - Source code
fsetboot.lst - Latest assembly listing

hdbt2.txt - A. Rubin's original text and patches on booting a 4P
from hard disk.  I haven't found this in too many other places
so this seems like a good place for people to find it.

hdbt2.bas - My program to write the patch files with the data
values filled in automatically with data from the current drive
:0.  This is so much easier than manually doing it.

mkhdboot.bas - A program to write out a FreHD hard disk header
(which can be mounted later and formatted).  The header values
for size and whatnot are easily edited, with defaults for a 406
cylinder drive with 8 heads.

Note: If you are using the FreHD menu to boot your hard disk, it
seems that you have to use only a single head for your drive :0 
partition.  You also need to avoid creating your drive :0 disk
with more than 203 cylinders.  1 physical per logical cylinder
is all I could make boot.
